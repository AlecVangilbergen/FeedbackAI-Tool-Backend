# Quick Start Guide for Organisations

This guide is for `organisations` to get started with the FeedbackAI-Tool. Organisations can use the FeedbackAI-Tool to manage teachers and students within their educational system.

## Organisation Setup

To get started with the FeedbackAI-Tool, organisations need to create an account and set up their organisation. The creation of an organisation needs to be done by the admin account. The admin account is given by the superuser of the tool when the tool is first set up.

### Organisation Creation

The admin account needs to log in into the tool. The admin account can then create an organisation by providing the following details:

- **Name**: The name of the organisation.
- **Username**: The username for the admin account of the organisation.
- **Password**: The password for the admin account of the organisation.

Once the organisation is created, the admin account can log in using the provided username and password.

### Adding Teachers and Students

After the organisation is set up, the admin account can add teachers and students to the organisation on the respective menu's found in the navigation bar. Teachers and students can be added by providing the following details:

- **Name**: The name of the teacher or student.
- **First Name**: The first name of the teacher or student.
- **Email**: The email address of the teacher or student.
- **Organisation**: The organisation to which the teacher or student belongs.
- **Password**: The password for the teacher or student account.

Once the teachers and students are added, they can log in using the provided email and password.
